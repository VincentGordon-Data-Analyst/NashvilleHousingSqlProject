# NashvilleHousingSqlProject

The excel file was found on:
https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx 

and then imported using Microsoft SQL Server.

This was a dataset was used to help get better at data cleaning using SQL. The query file shows how some columns were split (OwerAddress and PropertyAddress), Date changes (SaleDate), data changes ('Y' -> 'Yes') as well as removing duplicates.
